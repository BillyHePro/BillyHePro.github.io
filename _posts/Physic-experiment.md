***One day in the lab***

 

“Motion detector, gas pressure sensor, dual range mechanical sensor and so many fantastic things” That is what I found in the lab during experiment for IYPT(International Physicists Tournament).

 

Uniquely, my group started a subject which researched how variable factors influence the dynamics of beads. Since this term, I did lots of research on theory for two weeks to clear the factors we will aim for, and another two weeks for designing forms for observation and investigation. Last week, raw materials were processed and now we install these on the apparatus.

 

It is quite funny for us to carry out the experiment. The motor starts to revolve vigorously since we manage the bottom for speed carelessly. What’s more, the rolling ball spins out of the apparatus and falls somewhere randomly. Toughly finding it, I keep asking myself “How would this problem be solved?” One of our group members says we need to enhance the balanced weight of the annular, since the condition is that a ball body rolls in an annular groove, which rotates at a certain speed. That is true, the mass of semiconductors plays an important role in stabilizing apparatus, which also makes it accurate to study the object we focus on. Meanwhile, I increase the height of the side to avoid the ball falling frequently.

 

Our efforts make a successful experiment, the ball revolves for a certain time. So what comes next? Perhaps I need to think of a comprehensive scheme to observe changes on the ball due to various different exerts on it. I hope this will be figured out next week.
