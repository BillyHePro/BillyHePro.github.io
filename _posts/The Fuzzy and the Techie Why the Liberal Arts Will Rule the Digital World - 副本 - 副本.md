######           Today I participated in reading seminar and we discussed a book called **The Fuzzy and the Techie: Why the Liberal Arts Will Rule the Digital World.**

##### brief introduction 

 - *Stanford University in the US, humanities and social science students are described as "artsy", while engineering or natural science students are "tech-nerds".Behind these lighthearted epithets are debates and doubts about the relative value of various disciplines, the value of future jobs, and the role of education.
In an era led by technological innovation, will the "literary and artistic nerds" with a liberal arts education become obsolete?Where will big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and genome research lead us?Should "emphasis on science and light on literature" or "emphasis on literature and light on science"?*

-  *In the book, Scott Hartley, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and former adviser to the president on innovation, argues that technology is important, but it needs to be combined with a liberal arts education's understanding of psychology and the big issues of history and social development to make technology useful and truly human.*


-  *In the changing times, we embrace the real value of liberal education, combine "literary and artistic nerds" with "science and technology nerds", and have the core competitiveness.*



I can learn a lot from this book in three aspects:

- <u>*In the book "Literary and Artistic Ones and Technologists", the author points out that in today's society dominated by scientific and technological progress, humanities are not obsolete, but increasingly important. The core of great scientific and technological innovation is humanities, and only by combining technology and humanities can great progress and innovation continue to be produced.*</u>

- <u>*To solve parents' doubts about how to cultivate their children, point out how humanistic qualities and knowledge can bring people creativity and social competitiveness in the digital age, provide reference for Chinese college students when choosing majors, and provide choice directions for graduates' employment.*</u>

- <u>*For educators and business managers, the contents of this book will help solve the problems of enterprise innovation. The book tells us that make Chinese students or enterprise good employees age innovation pilot catalyst is to increase their humanistic literacy, let them not only proficient in technology, but also for people, for the reason behind the behavior of people have their own unique understanding and social demand, so they are more likely to find the ever-changing science and technology as in humans, innovation point to solve practical problems.*</u>

   ##### about author

Graduated from Stanford university, he has invested in more than 150 enterprises and previously served a government unit. The motivation of writing this book originated from his special study mode in college. Actually, he took politics and philosophy as well as his major scientific courses.

#####         discussion time

​        First, our teacher shared an experience in a US business college. It was strange that the whole teaching building looked like a plant with heavy machines and working desks. In fact, the teachers explained that they wanted students who entered school with engineering and business awareness skills to learn about diverse fields of knowledge and fit profound working communication easy and creative.

​         Then I did a further introduction of chapter one. It gave many examples of incredible ideas which came from trifles and were designed by well-thinking people who benefit from humanity subjects or similar   

experience. like the author's father used to recover his brain damage by computerized systems . 

This gave him the idea to convert psychological practice into virtual application. It is reported that 20 percent of lawyers' work will be replaced by well-trained machines to process essay preparation so that lawyers are capable of spending time on effective work. As government leaders are aware of the importance of interdisciplinary study, the world rolls on the positive side rather than making someone unemployed.

​        Some other students think they live in an involution of study. They admit that modern education is great progress and now drives them to trample and get a good position in living and working. The solution can be found in books easily: we should realize that we want indeed and concentrate on those subjects. Meanwhile, it is better to learn philosophy because sophisticated is needed for the development of a changeable world.

​          There is also another true story of our peer. He is a quite excellent learner for winning those prizes we have not got. It seems that we are nothing in front of him when applying for academic. something However, annoys him that it is harder to enter very top universities worldwide since competition still exists in his best class at an extraordinary school. Things is dramatic when he talked about nowhere to go in the future. We suggested him to seek out what he really love to do and keep passionate about immerse yourself studying every time. Furthermore, do not think an ideal life is entering best universities because each has their specific advanced fields. Truly, revolution can’t set too many limitations and no one can predict that, so does universities, it is you who shape your thought and knowledge all the time.

#####           conclusion

​         We really need to think about what we have learned seriously. It is not about getting a good mark or balancing pressure exerted by peers, but to discover gold from humanity and put it into designs. Recently, a tragedy occurred with an application called Pinduoduo, an automatic software for trunk drivers to do business. Confrontation began between male drivers and custom girl for the ladder carrying furniture by herself which cost lots of productive time for drivers. It was midnight and the girl was afraid and committed suicide jumping off the seat when the driver was too angry to reply why he ran out of the navigation in normal conditions. Responsibilities are hard to undertake but it can be avoided by better service provided by software like setting rules firstly and planning the navigation wisely rather than making profit as a third party. as a whole , we need to think widely and act corresponded to what we think positively.
