# after CIE exams, our school held a trip to diverse corporations to experience the careers we liked.

*I chose a project including two corporations, One is Jiahuan tech cor. And the other is Weisi cor. The formal one dedicates to telecom construction and the ladder one focuses on hardware medical treatment, mainly for pelvis recovery and psychological improvement.*

As we arrived, the manager welcomed us in front of the building. All of us were curious to look around to familiarize the environment. We rested on the second floor for a couple minutes, then entered the main floor where machines were separated in various rooms. The other manger introduced those boxes of machines—more precisely, there are bases from 1G to 5G. As I observed closely, a pattern drew into my mind that the altering generations were in pursuit of less plugs and more subunits. For example, the plugs were replaced from copper to fiber considering security, productivity and expenses. The way of installment changed a lot too. The wires were placed in double and at 45 degrees to ensure users everywhere received excellent signals. In terms of secure continuity, the boxes were placed with spare parts. The manager also mentioned some knowledge of physics to clear our doubts about the developing patterns. Meanwhile, another manager operated an online instruction to allocate the resources of Nanjing to Suzhou. She metaphorized this as trains’ orbital transfer.

​    *At noon, we had a lazy lunch at software valley. My friend Jiahao skimmed the halls for something delicious to eat. He felt excited to learn so much about the IT industry and was busy reexamining the afternoon’s questions he prepared.*

​    The Weisi cor. Had a hotel-liked hall with cool air-conditioning, some naughty students sat in soft soda to play games. What a nice service! Then a hospitable staff guided our trip. The first step was watching promotional videos in the studio on the first floor. The film I enjoyed most was its splendid scenes and tactfully shot alternation. Then we stepped twenties steps and saw simple plaques on the walls to outline the cor.’s past with glories. Then we entered the main showroom with three types of products: dysphagia treatment, pelvis recovery and stroke improvement. He told us the principle of each product, along with security & reliability. I learnt that qualified medical treatment involved safety and effectiveness. For instance, the dysphrenia treatment needed to connect bio-pulse sites on the head, the design used fibers as the plugs to prevent current leaking from electronic devices into humans’ brain as bioelectricity. Some classmates experienced these products with interactive software which quantifies the relaxation and muscle tension all the time. This treatment aimed to calm down patients’ psychology by vivid images and fun games to diagnose and treat. After the elementary visit, the manager gave us a talk about the background, experience and so much about cor. He also answered several questions responsibly.

 

 **So what I learnt from this journey can be concluded into three parts: the ability to study well in related subjects(perhaps that means a whole thing!), the willingness to figure out complex things in the right directions; the skills to communicate with others to create meaningful things, not just the huge market shares.**
